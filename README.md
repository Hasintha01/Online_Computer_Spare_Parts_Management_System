# Online_Computer_Spare_Parts_Management_System

## Introduction

**Online_Computer_Spare_Parts_Management_System** is a web-based platform designed to streamline the management, ordering, and distribution of computer spare parts. It enables customers to search and purchase spare parts, sellers to manage inventory, and admins to oversee supplier approvals, delivery updates, and reporting. The system ensures a user-friendly experience for buyers, sellers, and administrators.

This project was developed collaboratively by a group of students.
